# Lei's Scavenger Hunt

A scavenger secret santa gift in 2019 where I hid parts of the present throughout the office.
Each part has a code that gives a hint as to where the next part is.

All of the code validations happen client side, to prevent "cheating", uglified the javascript and then saved it in jquery.min.js, although now that I think about it he could have just removed the `display: none` styles on the divs...

Unfortunately I have not been able to find a way to unminify it and lost the codes :facepalm:. So if you'd like to see all clues, you'll have to inspect the html and remove the `display: nones` styles manually.
